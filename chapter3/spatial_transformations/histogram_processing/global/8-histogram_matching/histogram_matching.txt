histogram_matching

Goal:
    Suppose we have to PDFs: p_r which is relative to image I and p_z. We want
    to find a transformation from I to get the output which its PDF (and so its
    histogram) be similar (scaled shape) to p_z.

Theoretical:
    We know there is a transformation like T which transforms p_r to uniform
    random variable in [0,L-1]. Also another one like G for p_z. Theoretically
    both G and T are strictly monotonical increasing functions. So G^{-1}
    exists. Now T maps p_r to uniform and G^{-1} maps uniform to p_z. So
    G^{-1}(T) maps p_r to p_z.  □

Practical:
    In practice, T and G may be not 1-1. So for mapping p_r to p_z:
        find T and G (HE for p_r and p_z)
        for each r_0 bin in source bins
            find s_0 where s_0=T(r_0)
            find nearest element in R_G to s_0, for example sʹ_0
            find z_0 which G maps it to sʹ_0
            map r_0 to z_0
    
    But what have we do if there are z_0 and z_1 which G maps both to sʹ and
    there is rʹ in D_T which T(rʹ)=sʹ?
        In this case we cannot solve the problem.
    So:
        G must be 1-1 at least for all elments in R_T.
    But Gonzalez has a convention for these cases:
        When more than one value of zq gives the same match (i.e., the mapping
        is not unique), choose the smallest value by convention.
