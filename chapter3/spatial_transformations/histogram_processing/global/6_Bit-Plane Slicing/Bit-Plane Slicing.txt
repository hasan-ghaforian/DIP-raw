To get most significant bit (MSB) and Least significant bit (LSB), convert data
to bit. Left bit is MSB and right bit is LSB.
Left bit is called MSB because if left bit of 11111111 is changed to 0 (i.e.
01111111), then the value changes from 255 to 127. But if you change the right
bit, it will change from 255 to 254.

For 8bit (uint8) image, 8th plane is MSB

transformation for getting nth plane from decimal number
    integrally divide number to 2^{n-1} get the mode of result to the 2

transformation for getting nth plane from binary number
    bit shifting 

compositing of bit-planes
    for ith plane mutiply its element by 2^{i-1}
    pluse all multiplied planes

number of colors in each bit plane: 2
number of colors by compositing m bit-plane: 2^m
