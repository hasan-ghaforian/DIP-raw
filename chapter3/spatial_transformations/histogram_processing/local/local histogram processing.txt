Result for each pixel in these ways does not depend on doing globally or
locally: 
    negative
    gamma
    logarithmic
    Intensity Level Slicing
    Bit-Plane Slicing

Above is true while you do not compute their arguments based on set of pixels.
For example if you select ùùà of pixels as argument for gamma correction, then
its value may be different while you calculate it for all pixels of image or an
area of it.

For "contrast stretching" when we use percentage thresholding, its local and
global may differ.

Approaches for local histogram processing (Gonzalez pages 149,150):
    The procedure is to deÔ¨Åne a neighborhood and move its center from pixel to
    pixel in a horizontal or vertical direction. At each location, the histogram
    of the points in the neighborhood is computed, and either a histogram
    equalization or histogram speciÔ¨Åcation transformation function is obtained.
    This function is used to map the intensity of the pixel centered in the
    neighborhood. The center of the neighborhood is then moved to an adjacent
    pixel location and the procedure is repeated.

    Another approach used sometimes to reduce computation is to utilize 
    nonoverlapping regions, but this method usually produces an undesirable
    ‚Äúblocky‚Äù effect.

For the first approach:
    Because only one row or column of the neighborhood changes in a one-pixel
    translation of the neighborhood, updating the histogram obtained in the
    previous location with the new data introduced at each motion step is
    possible (see Problem 3.14). This approach has obvious advantages over
    repeatedly computing the histogram of all pixels in the neighborhood region
    each time the region is moved one pixel location.
