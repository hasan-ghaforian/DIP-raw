SMOOTHING (LOWPASS) SPATIAL FILTERS

smoothing <-> average

Usage
    Smoothing (also called averaging) spatial filters are used to reduce sharp 
    transitions in intensity.
        Noise reduction > random noise typically consists of sharp transitions
        Resampling > before resampling for avoiding aliasing 
        reduce irrelevant detail > pixel regions that are small with respect to
            the size of the filter kernel
        smoothing the false contours

Types
    linear
        convolving an image with a Ô¨Ålter kernel
            box 
            Gaussian
    nonlinear

    Both Gaussian and Box filters are separable
