This filter works well for removing noise, especially impulse noise (Salt and
pepper noise).
allows the preserving of edges while removing noise.

smoothing (also)

select element (m^2+1)/2 as result.

Isolated clusters of pixels that are light or dark with respect to their
neighbors, and whose area is less than m^2/2 (one-half the ﬁlter area), are
forced by an m × m median ﬁlter to have the value of the median intensity of the
pixels in the neighborhood. So small objects (not only their edges) will be
deleted! 

Why is smoothing? because remove noises.
