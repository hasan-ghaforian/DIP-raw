SHARPENING_(HIGHPASS)_SPATIAL_FILTERS

Way:    highlights transitions in intensity

Edges in images are areas with strong intensity contrasts; a jump in intensity
from one pixel to the next. 

We use averaging for doing smoothing which is analogous for integral.
We use differetiation for doing sharpening.

The strength of the response of a derivative operator is proportional to the
magnitude of the intensity discontinuity at the point at which the operator is
applied. 

Image differentiation 
    enhances
        discontinuities
            edges
            noise
    de-emphasizes
        areas with slowly varying intensities

Usually two ways based on differentiation:
    Laplacian
        searches for zero crossings in the second derivative of the image. 
    gradient
        detects the edges by looking for the maximum and minimum in the first
        derivative of the image.

Gradiant
    âˆ‡ is the direction and rate of fastest increase
    If the gradient of a function is non-zero at a point p, the direction of the gradient is the direction in which the function increases most quickly from p, and the magnitude of the gradient is the rate of increase in that direction, the greatest absolute directional derivative.
