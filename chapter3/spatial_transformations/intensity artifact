Pixels with different intensities help us to understand information (for example
edges, depth, ...).
If a transformation map two different intensities to the same value, probably we
loss the informations understandable from those different pixels and different
intensities. 
Although not 1-1 transformation may improve quality accidently; but there is a
probablity of lossing data.
But with 1-1 transformation, although we have not accidently improving; but at
least we will be sure that we do not loss data and that transformation does
not change state to worse state.

Summary
not 1-1 transformation surely loss data compare to source image -> probably
accidental:
    improving
    worse result
We are trying to find ways that surely does not change state to worse: improving
quality with minimum data loos â†’ sure choices, not accidental
