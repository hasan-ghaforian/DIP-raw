Spatial domain:
The section of the real plane spanned by the coordinates of an image is called
the spatial domain, with x and y being referred to as spatial variables or spatial coordinates.


Intensity Transformations and Spatial Filtering

Image processing: <b>transformaing</b> data (intensity) of pixels to another
data. Both <i>spatial processing</i> and <i>transform processing</i>
transformations do transformatinos. So what is the different?

Incorrect thought about spatial processing ways:
<ul>
    <li>
        <s>work on pixels and we know intensity of each pixel will be
            transformed to what</s>.
    </li>
    <li><s>Directly change the intensity of pixels by a transformation.</s></li>
</ul>

<p>Specification of <i>transform processing</i> ways:<br/>
    First transforming an image into the transform domain, doing the processing
    there, and obtaining the inverse transform to bring the results back into the spatial domain.
</p>

<p>
    In both <i>Spatial processing</i> and <i>transform processing</i>
    transformations, transformation may be a combination of multiple
    transformations; but the meaning of pixels remain. It means after any
    transformation, the result is an image, and so the result of all
    Transformations. But in <i>transform domain</i>, there is a time you do a
    transformation but its result is not an image (when you transform image to
    transform domain); although the result of all transformations in a <i>transform domain</i> is also an image.
</p>

Spatial processing ways:
<ul>
    <li>
        Intensity transformations<br />
        point processing<br/>
        Its input is a single pixel of image<br />
        contrast manipulation and image thresholding
    </li>
    <li>
        Spatial ﬁltering<br />
        (neighborhood processing)<br/>
        Performs operations on the neighborhood of every pixel<br />
        image smoothing and sharpening
    </li>
</ul>

In intensity transformations, <code>s=T(r)</code> shows the output only depends
on intensity of pixel ↔ all pixels with same intensity will have same output

usage of spatial processing in apps:
<ol>
    <li>directly in broad range of apps</li>
    <li>
        providing better image for specific application than original one<br/>
        most thechniques in this purpose.
    </li>
</ol>

Terminology

intensity compression « when image is washed-out
    more darker
intensity widening-expanding
    more lighter
