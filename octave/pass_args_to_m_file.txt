I used this in "AFT_0.m" file:

	printf ("args of %s:\n", program_name ());
	arg_list = argv ();
	for i = 1:nargin
	  printf (" %s", arg_list{i});
	  printf ("\n");
	endfor
	printf ("\n");

For passing args to that .m file, do like this in terminal:

	$ octave-cli ./AFT_0.m 0 1
	args of AFT_0.m:
	 0
	 1

Note: I passed args in terminal by using <code>octave-cli</code> command. and 
not in the command line of Octave. For passing in Octave command line, see 
https://octave.discourse.group/t/input-arguments-not-recognized-in-the-script/1683/4
and also search again.
